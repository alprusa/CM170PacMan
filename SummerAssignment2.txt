Second C++/SFML assignment

The second game implementation assignment using C++/SFML is as follows:

 

You are to re-implement the classic game of Pac-Mac, which you can find here:
http://www.freepacman.org/

 

Key features to implement:

 

* Score feature

* Power pills and vulnerable blue ghosts

* Correct ghost AI (see:
http://gameinternals.com/post/2072558330/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior and
http://home.comcast.net/~jpittman2/pacman/pacmandossier.html for detailed descriptions)
including chase/scatter modes

* Non-sticky movement (if I hit up and above me is a wall, I don't stick on the wall, and I
keep going)

* Level startup music

* Waka-waka sound

* Ghost eating sound

* Player death sound

* At least two levels

* Game resets to title screen when player runs out of lives

* Tunnel from one side to the other side

 

Extra-credit: implementing fruit

 

You should mimic the look of the original Pac-Man game as much as possible.

 

As with the Pong game, when complete, submit a link to a gameplay video and a link to your code
on GitHub in the comments below.

 

Due date for this is Friday, August 7. Good luck!
